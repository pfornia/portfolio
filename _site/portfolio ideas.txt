# RESEARCH TOPIC IDEAS

## "Highly Teachable AI"
	The biggest problem with ML right now are the barrier and skill needed for training *and/or* the skill and resources needed to prepare the dataset.

	**Existing research on deep learning with fewer observations.

	This might be the intersection of human-focused design and reinforcement learning.

	Inspiration: Consider learning chess:
		Nobody learns just by any of the following methods:
			* running simulations
			* learning rules
			* planning ahead
			* memorizing big data.
		Good players ALWAYS have some a combination of all of the above:
			* practice (simulations)
			* rules (strategies taught by experts)
			* planning (look 5 moves ahead)
			* memorizing openings/learning from gathering data from existing 				games
	
	Similarly in data science (just like a human), a good Analytics AI will:
		Provide some analytics
		Get an objective function
		Be told why it's wrong
		Adjust objective
		Collect different data
		etc.
		* Learn from others ("Always cross validate")
		* ??
			

# Data Science

## MNIST CNN in excel? D3? (with interactive click-draw digits)



# Coding

## minimax chess
* chess solver with minimax (w/ alpha beta) and heuristic of piece points
* Could the UI be done in D3?
* Is there some sort of database? Some big data solution here?

## heuristic, minimax Tic-tac-toe (suboptimal) (see AI class, mod 2 self-check problem set.)


## Logic
### Sudoku based on logic AI stuff (mod 6)
### Can the wupus rules be learned by reenforcement? 

### convert tax code into logical knowledge base



# Open source

* Jupyter needs a find function! (has a find and replace, but needs some work)


# Terms to learn

Lagrange
Eigen stuff
Chi squared
Markov stuff
